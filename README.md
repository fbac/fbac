### Welcome, visitor! 👋

My name is **Borja**, and I've been always connected to opensource, development and unix through my entire work life.

- I work @ **Red Hat** since 2016, and through my whole work life I've been connected to **Open Source** and **Unix/Linux** environments, **kernels**, **networking** and **development**.
- My current role is **Principal Software Engineer**, working mainly with OpenShift/Kubernetes, container runtimes, developing tools, contributing, bugfixing... I guess software engineer thingies.
- Preferred programming languages are **C**, **Python** and **Golang**. And I'm deeply interested in learning **Rust** and collaborate in some opensource project.
- I like to automate stuff to do the boring chore tasks for me, also CI/CD using Github Actions / Jenkins or whatever other platform brings me joy. (Isn't it beautiful when everything just works?)
- I'm and avid student and I love to be in continuous brain development myself.
- My final goal is to contribute to the linux kernel with some patch. And for that I keep studying and hacking in my own time. :)
