## Who am I?

<img style="float: left;  margin-right: 10px;" src="avatar.jpg" width="150" height="150">

I'm a Software Engineer who is passionate about technology and how to talk with computers at the lowest level.
And weirdly enough, I enjoy reading RFC to *really* understand how current computers and standards are built.

I enjoy working from low level projects for operating systems, networking to contributing to modern projects such as Kubernetes, OpenShift... in general everything that represents a challenge and growing.

Developing my skills is a constant, and I have strong foundations in computer sciences, operating systems and networking, and I'm always aiming for more knowledge. 
I consider myself a highly motivated individual with an always-growing and curious mindset about everything regarding technology. And I'm always eager to just jump on the documentation until I'm capable of understanding and debugging whatever I have in front of me, even if it's an embedded system, a network protocol or a piece of code, I'm just curious and canÂ´t help it.

In my career I've worked as Linux System Administrator, Software Engineer, Consultant, and I've always loved working with linux and open-source technologies. I'm a hard-worker, maybe a bit obsessive and inquisitive when it comes to find why and how "something" is doing "something". I've worked as part of small, medium and big teams and also as an alone wolf, I love collaboration, productive discussions and listening to a million opinions, because I firmly believe that we grow when we share, and that's an intrinsic part of the Open Source values I follow.

I code in a variety of languages such as C, go, python and java, and I have scripting skills in good old bash. 
My most used language is golang as it's the language I'm using the most currently. But also I really enjoy coding in C (it's just... awesome) and lately I'm really interested in Rust, learning it and I'll look for projects written in it to contribute in the future.
